To help you get started using Barc to store your important barcodes, I’ve put together a short tour. If you’ve used Barc before, or would rather just get started, feel free to skip it and jump right into saving.

Either way, I hope you have a great time using Barc! If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact me from the settings menu at any time.
